Sequential/Linear
	- iterate through list
	- is it the element you need?
	- takes lots of computing power!
	- for loop, nested if-statement
Binary
	- large data sets
	- RESTRICTION: the list/array MUST be IN ORDER 
		- doesn't work w/out it
	- while element not found
		- go to middle index of unchecked values in list
			- if element > index = eliminate all indices before
			- if element < index = eliminate all indices after
				- else = return index
